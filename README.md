# fizzbuzz

We were asked to create a program using Ruby and RSpec that would be able to:

1. Return 'fizz' when provided with a number divisible by 3.
2. Return 'buzz' when provided with a number divisible by 5
3. Return 'fizzbuzz' when provided with a number divisble by 15.
4. Return the number when none of these parameters applied.

## Motivation

This task was designed to expose us to RSpec and had to be completed using pair programming.
