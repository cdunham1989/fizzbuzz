# fizzbuzz

We were asked to create a program using Ruby and RSpec that would be able to:

1. Return 'fizz' when provided with a number divisible by 3.
2. Return 'buzz' when provided with a number divisible by 5
3. Return 'fizzbuzz' when provided with a number divisble by 15.
4. Return the number when none of these parameters applied.

## Motivation

This task was designed to expose us to RSpec and had to be completed using pair programming.

## Extra Information

This task was our first exposure to using RSpec. It was therefore important for us to break this task down into the smallest possible steps we could so that we could fully understand how RSpec fit into the process and also produced the most reliable test possible.

Paired programming proved to be an incredibly useful way of completing this challenge as it enabled us to support each other effectively when we came across a problem. It became clear to us that we were both keen to solve this problem using the least resource intensive method possible and so we refactored as many times as possible. We were keen to research further ways we could solve the problem more efficiently.

We explored alternative ways of solving the problem using classes and came up with a solution. but overall we felt this solution was the sleakest way we could produce the correct response each time.
